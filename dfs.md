# Depth-First Search (DFS) Load Balancing

## Description

DFS load balancing explores each instance's load in depth, evaluating multiple levels of load metrics. This thorough assessment helps in finding the optimal instance for request handling.

### Key Features:

1. **In-Depth Analysis:** Examines each instance's load in depth, providing a comprehensive load assessment.
2. **Optimal Allocation:** Helps in finding the most suitable instance for request handling.
3. **Adaptability:** Can be adjusted to consider various load metrics and levels of detail.

### Use Case:

DFS load balancing is useful in complex environments where a detailed assessment of instance loads is necessary, such as in cloud computing platforms, large-scale web applications, or distributed databases.

## Implementation

Here is the C++ implementation of the DFS Load Balancing algorithm. This implementation uses depth-first search to evaluate instance loads and assign requests.
