# Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) for Load Balancing

## Description

Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a probabilistic technique inspired by the foraging behavior of ants. It is used for solving computational problems which can be reduced to finding good paths through graphs. In the context of load balancing, ACO helps in dynamically distributing incoming requests to various instances by simulating the pheromone trail-following behavior of ants.

### Key Features:

1. **Pheromone-Based Learning:** Utilizes pheromone trails to probabilistically determine the best paths, adapting over time based on the success of previous decisions.
2. **Dynamic and Adaptive:** Continuously adjusts to changing conditions and workloads, ensuring optimal resource utilization.
3. **Robustness:** Handles dynamic and unpredictable loads effectively by leveraging the collective learning of multiple agents (ants).

### Use Case:

ACO is ideal for complex, dynamic environments where the workload is unpredictable and the goal is to optimize resource utilization in real-time. It can be used in cloud environments like OpenStack to enhance load balancing by making intelligent, adaptive decisions based on real-time metrics.

## Implementation

Here is the C++ implementation of the ACO-based load balancing algorithm. This implementation collects CPU and memory usage metrics and uses ACO to distribute incoming requests to instances.
