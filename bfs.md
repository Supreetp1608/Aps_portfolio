# Breadth-First Search (BFS) Load Balancing

## Description

BFS load balancing examines instances' load level by level, ensuring a fair and balanced consideration of all instances. It finds the least loaded instance in a balanced manner.

### Key Features:

1. **Level-Wise Analysis:** Evaluates instance loads level by level, providing a balanced load assessment.
2. **Fair Distribution:** Ensures a fair and balanced consideration of all instances.
3. **Scalability:** Suitable for large-scale systems with multiple levels of load metrics.

### Use Case:

BFS load balancing is ideal for large-scale systems where a balanced and fair distribution of load is essential, such as in multi-tier web applications, large-scale distributed systems, or cloud infrastructure.

## Implementation

Here is the C++ implementation of the BFS Load Balancing algorithm. This implementation uses breadth-first search to evaluate instance loads and assign requests.
